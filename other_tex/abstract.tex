We close the constants story for the Planck-Cell (S/t) program by
operationalizing the electromagnetic coupling. We recast the fine-structure
constant as a stitch–capacity fraction,
\[
\alpha \;=\; \frac{\mathcal Q_{\rm EM}}{\mathcal Q_{\max}},\qquad \mathcal Q_{\max}=\hbar c,
\]
so that the EM sector claims a fixed share of the universal tick-throughput.
Equivalently, we match a vacuum ratio to a matter normalization,
\[
\alpha \;=\; \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar c} \;=\; \frac{Z_0}{2R_K},
\]
where \(Z_0\) is the vacuum impedance and \(R_K=h/e^2\) the quantum of
resistance. In this view the elementary charge \(e\) is the minimal packet of
the EM channel’s fractional flow, while the long-wavelength limit fixes a
frequency-independent \(Z_0\). We keep scope to vacuum electrodynamics and
coupling normalization: fields propagate at the hop-cap speed \(c\), gauge
appears as phase bookkeeping, and energy/momentum flux follows a discrete
Poynting balance. Precision readouts come from hydrogenic observables
(\(v/c=\alpha\), \(a_0\), \(R_H\), Balmer/Lyman lines) and cross-platform
determinations of \(\alpha(\mu)\) (recoil, \(g\!-\!2\), quantum Hall), including
running with scale. Falsifiers are dispersion, anisotropy, birefringence,
Proca-like photon mass, or impedance drift that fails to vanish with
wavelength; residuals must obey \(r(\lambda)\!\lesssim\!A(\xi_g/\lambda)^p\),
\(p>0\). The result is a compact, testable closure of EM coupling within the
same tick-based rate language that fixed \(c,\hbar,G,k_B\).
