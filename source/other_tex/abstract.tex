\section*{Abstract}
We express electromagnetism as a fixed fraction of the tick-mediumâ€™s
per-tick throughput, interpreting the fine-structure constant
\(\alpha\) as a capacity share rather than a free parameter.
The electromagnetic coupling becomes
\[
\alpha = \frac{\mathcal Q_{\rm EM}}{\mathcal Q_{\max}}
       = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar c}
       = \frac{Z_0}{2R_K},
\]
so the EM sector claims a constant portion of the universal rate budget.
The elementary charge \(e\) is the minimal packet of that fractional flow,
while the long-wavelength limit fixes the vacuum impedance \(Z_0\).
Gauge structure appears as phase bookkeeping, and field energy follows a
discrete Poynting balance. Precision readouts (hydrogenic spectra,
\(g{-}2\), quantum Hall, recoil) verify the same coupling, with possible
scale-running encoded in \(\alpha(\mu)\).
Falsifiers include photon mass, anisotropy, or impedance drift that fails
to vanish with wavelength. The result closes the constants story for the
Planck-Cell S/t framework within one causal-rate language for
\(c,\hbar,G,k_B,\) and \(\alpha\).
