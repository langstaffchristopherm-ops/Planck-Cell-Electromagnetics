\section*{Scope and falsifiability}
This paper formulates the electromagnetic coupling as a fractional
capacity share of the universal tick throughput, identifying
\(\alpha = Q_{\mathrm{EM}}/Q_{\max}\) with \(Q_{\max} = \hbar c\).
The analysis applies to interior regions of a bounded-degree,
approximately isotropic adjacency network in which no entity advances
more than one hop per global tick.  The framework is falsified by any
persistent residual that fails to vanish with increasing wavelength
\(\lambda\) relative to the grain scale~\(\xi_g\).  Immediate falsifiers include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item measurable vacuum dispersion, anisotropy, or birefringence
        yielding fractional residuals that do not follow the suppression
        law \(r(\lambda)\!\lesssim\!A(\xi_g/\lambda)^{p}\) with \(p>0\);
  \item frequency-dependent or direction-dependent drift in the vacuum
        impedance \(Z_{0}\) inconsistent with a constant long-wavelength
        limit;
  \item detection of a finite photon rest mass or Proca-like cutoff that
        breaks the hop-cap propagation condition \(v_{g}=c\);
  \item cross-platform determinations of the fine-structure constant
        \(\alpha(\mu)\) at the same scale~\(\mu\) that disagree beyond
        experimental uncertainty.
\end{enumerate}
Any confirmed non-vanishing dispersion, anisotropy, impedance drift, or
inconsistent value of~\(\alpha\) falsifies the electromagnetic layer of the
framework.
