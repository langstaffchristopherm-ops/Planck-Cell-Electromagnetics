\section*{Introduction}

In \emph{Planck--Cell Electromagnetics} the electromagnetic coupling constant is
recast as a fractional capacity share of the universal tick throughput.
Each tick carries a maximal action flux $Q_{\max} = \hbar c$, and the fine--
structure constant $\alpha = Q_{\mathrm{EM}}/Q_{\max}$ measures the EM sector's
fractional claim on that capacity.  This reinterpretation connects
$\alpha = e^2/(4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c)$ to vacuum impedance $Z_0$ and quantum
resistance $R_K$, placing charge quantization and coupling strength within the
same discrete causal ledger that fixes $c$, $\hbar$, and $k_B$.  Residuals such
as dispersion or impedance drift define direct falsification tests.
